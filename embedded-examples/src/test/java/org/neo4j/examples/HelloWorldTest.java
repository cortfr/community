     * Hello World.
     * 
     * Learn how to create and access nodes, relationships and properties.
     * For information on project setup, see <<tutorials-java-embedded-setup>>.
     * 
     * Remember, from <<what-is-a-graphdb>>, that a Neo4j graph consist of:
     * 
     * * Nodes that are connected by
     * * Relationships, with
     * * Properties on both nodes and relationships.
     * 
     * All relationships have a type.
     * For example, if the graph represents a social network, a relationship type could be +KNOWS+.
     * If a relationship of the type +KNOWS+ connects two nodes, that probably represents two people that know each other.
     * A lot of the semantics (that is the meaning) of a graph is encoded in the relationship types of the application.
     * And although relationships are directed they are equally well traversed regardless of which direction they are traversed. 
     * 
     * == Prepare the database ==
     * 
     * Relationship types can be created by using an +enum+.
     * In this example we only need a single relationship type. This is how to
     * define it:
     * 
     * @@createReltype
     * 
     * The next step is to start the database server. Note that if the directory
     * given for the database doesn't already exist, it will be created.
     * 
     * @@startDb
     * 
     * Note that starting a server is an expensive operation, so don't start up
     * a new instance every time you need to interact with the
     * database! The instance can be shared by multiple threads.
     * Transactions are thread confined.
     * 
     * As seen, we register a shutdown hook that will make sure the database
     * shuts down when the JVM exits. Now it's time to interact with the
     * database.
     * 
     * == Wrap mutating operations in a transaction ==
     * 
     * All mutating transactions have to be performed in a transaction.
     * This is a conscious design decision, since we believe transaction demarcation to be an important part of working with a real enterprise database.
     * Now, transaction handling in Neo4j is very easy:
     * 
     * @@transaction
     * 
     * For more information on transactions, see <<transactions>> and
     * http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/org/neo4j/graphdb/Transaction.html[Java API for +Transaction+].
     * 
     * == Create a small graph ==
     * 
     * Now, let's create a few nodes.
     * The API is very intuitive.
     * Feel free to have a look at the JavaDocs at http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j/{neo4j-version}/apidocs/.
     * They're included in the distribution, as well.
     * Here's how to create a small graph consisting of two nodes, connected with one relationship and some properties: 
     * 
     * @@addData
     * 
     * We now have a graph that looks like this: 
     * 
     * @@graph
     * 
     * == Print the result ==
     * 
     * After we've created our graph, let's read from it and print the result. 
     * 
     * @@readData
     * 
     * Which will output:
     * 
     * @@output
     * 
     * == Remove the data ==
     * 
     * In this case we'll remove the data afterwards:
     * 
     * @@removingData
     * 
     * Note that deleting a node which still has relationships when the transaction commits will fail.
     * This is to make sure relationships always have a start node and an end node.
     * 
     * == Shut down the database server ==
     * 
     * Finally, shut down the database server _when the application finishes:_
